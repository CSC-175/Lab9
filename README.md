# Print a Sequence of Fibonacci Numbers

## Background
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two that precede it. Starting with the first two numbers 0 and 1, the sequence 
looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on forever. The Fibonacci sequence can be described using the following mathematical equation:
$`X_{n+2} = X_{n+1} + X_{n}`$

## Directions
Write a program that will prompt the user for an integer that will define the length of the Fibonacci sequence to print to the screen. This solution must use a loop without any arrays.
