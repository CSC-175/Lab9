// The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum 
// of the two that precede it. Starting at 0 and 1, the sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on forever. 
// The Fibonacci sequence can be described using a mathematical equation: XN+2 = XN+1 + XN

// Write a program that will prompt the user for an integer that will define how many values in the Fibonacci sequence to print to the screen.
